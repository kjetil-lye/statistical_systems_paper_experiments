# Overview of experiment data

*All* plots in the paper are generated from the notebooks found in this folder.

The raw data for the plots can be downloaded from https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/P5wQUi6c7vS4gKY

All raw data was made from the Alsvinn simulator. Run configuration files can be found along with the raw data. Simulations were run on the CSCS cluster (for Kelvin-Helmholtz) and on the Euler cluster (for the other experiments).

This readme is currently a work in progress. If you have troubles replicating the results, consult Kjetil Olsen Lye at kjetil.o.lye@gmail.com
