# statistical_systems_paper_experiments
Experiments for paper [U. S. Fjordholm, K. Lye, S. Mishra, F. Weber, Statistical solutions of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws: numerical approximation,  preprint arXiv:1906.02536 [math.NA]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02536). This repository contains all the post processing done to the numerical experiments (ie. making convergence plots)

We maintain a [seperate repository for the configurations for all the runs](https://github.com/kjetil-lye/systemspaper_experiments). Also available as a submodule in this repository as ```systemspaper_experiments```.
