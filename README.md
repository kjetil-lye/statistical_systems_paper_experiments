# statistical_systems_paper_experiments
Experiments for the systems paper. This repository contains all the post processing done to the numerical experiments (ie. making convergence plots)

We maintain a [seperate repository for the configurations for all the runs](https://github.com/kjetil-lye/systemspaper_experiments).
